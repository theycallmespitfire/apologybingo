			<h1>HH <em>"Response"</em> Bingo</h1>
			<p><strong>ATTENTION MLH:</strong> Your logo is used as part of a parody. Mostly making fun of how closely you work with HH on top of your own ridiculous non-responses.</p>
			<p><strong>Bonus points:</strong> Use the Namecheap coupon "RESPONSEBONUS" for every bonus, then feel sad when it doesn't work.</p>
			<p id="norandom"><strong>Your bingo card is not randomized!</strong></p>
